## How do I import Stripe data to Google Sheets?

Stripe is one of the largest payment processors for the web. Stripeâ€™s products power payments for online and in-person retailers, subscriptions businesses, software platforms and marketplaces, and everything in between. In this guide, I'll walk you through how to import data from Stripe into Google Sheets.

** BEFORE YOU BEGIN **

If you haven't already, install the Data Connector Add-on for Google Sheets from the [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/appname/529655450076)

**Step 1: Get your Stripe Secret key**

Login to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard) and click on the `Get your API keys` link.
